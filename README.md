# Demystifying Cusomer Behavior Using Market Basket Analysis

# Overview

This project aims to anticipate customer behaviour as in identifying the typical grocery products that are bought together i.e bread and butter.I am mainly using the "Association Mining Rule", it differs from a typical "Recommendation System" in a sense that it doesn't look into a particular customer's preference.

I am specifically using the "Apriori Algorithm" tha mainly takes in in as parameters, records which is a collection of lists,min_support as in a probability value to select the items with support values greater than the value specified by the parameter, min_confidence that is a probability value to filter rules with greater confidence than the specified threshold,
min_lift that is minimum lift value to shortlist the list of rules and min_length that is the minimum number of items you want in your rules.
